	// (SERIAL_CHECK) or interrupts (SERIAL_AUTOMATIC; the default)
	// for sending and receiving serial data.  If the mode is set to
	// SERIAL_CHECK, the function serialCheck() must be called

	// Data will go into this buffer until size bytes have been
	// stored.

	// timeout has elapsed to return.  Returns true on timeout, false
	// on buffer fill.

	// receiveRing: Sets up a ring buffer for background receive.
	// Data will go into this buffer, and when size bytes have been
	// stored, it will wrap around to the beginning, with
	// getReceivedBytes reset to 0.

	// cancelReceive: Stops receiving serial bytes.

	// getReceivedBytes: Gets the number of bytes that have been received since
	// receive() was called.

	// receiveBufferFull: True when the receive buffer is full.

	// send: Sets up a buffer for background transmit.
	// Data from this buffer will be transmitted until size bytes have
	// been sent.  If send() is called before sendBufferEmpty()
	// returns true (when transmission of the last byte has started),
	// the old buffer will be discarded and tramission will be cut
	// short.  This means that you should almost always wait until the
	// data has been sent before calling this function again.  See
	// sendBlocking(), below, for an easy way to do this.

	// sendBlocking: Same as send(), but waits until transmission of the last byte
	// has started to return.  When this function returns, it is safe
	// to call send() or sendBlocking() again.

	// getSentBytes: Gets the number of bytes that have been sent since send() was
	// called.

	// sendBufferEmpty: True when the send buffer is empty.
