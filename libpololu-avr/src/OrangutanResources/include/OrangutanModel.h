/*
  OrangutanModel.h - Header file for determining which Orangutan model is
    being used.

	This header file tests for the __AVR_ATmega* macros, and uses that
	to define the _ORANGUTAN_* macros, which are used when compiliing
	the library to compile different code for the different Orangutan
	models.

	This file is part of the internal implementation of the library; we
	do not recommend using the macros defined here in your code, because
	they may change.  You should instead copy the code in this file in to
	your own header file, and remove the leading underscore from the
	_ORANGUTAN_* macro names.
