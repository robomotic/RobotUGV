/*
   OrangutanPulseIn.cpp - Library for reading digital pulses with the
	Orangutan LV, SV, SVP, X2, Baby Orangutan B, or 3pi robot.  Pulses
	are measured in ticks, which have units of 0.4 us.  Note that the
	pulse info is updated by pin change interrupts as the pulses occur,
	so unless you use the get_pulse_info() function to freeze a snapshot
	of the current pulse state, values might change on you in unexpected
	ways.  For example, if you want to do something only when there is
	a new high pulse, you might do the following:
	
	if (new_high_pulse(0) && !new_low_pulse(0))
		do something with pulse data
		
	However, a pulse might occur right after you make it past the if
	statement but before you run your conditional code, changing the
	condition to one that would never have made it past the if statement.
